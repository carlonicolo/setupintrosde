Script to install and set the Environment for Introduction service design and engineering course
This scritp will install the Oracle jdk, git and maven
You need to execute this script as root because there are some
commands that only root can perform

The first thing you need to do is to download the Oracle JDK ---> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
select the file ---> jdk-8u60-linux-i586.tar.gz 
Then copy the jdk-8u60-linux-i586.tar.gz in the same location where you will execute the script
It means that you need to place this file (jdk-8u60-linux-i586.tar.gz) in the same folder where you will execute the script SetUpIntroSDE

In order to execute this script you need to give permissions:
Command---> chmod +x SetUpIntroSDE'
For executing this script and install the full Environment (JDK 1.8, Git and Maven)
you can type this command:
./SetUpIntroSDE -A
I suggest to execute the script in this way because doing this you will install the full Environment.
When the script is installing the jdk you need to select and set this version as default for your system, selecting the right number at the prompt

At the end you will have all the Environment installed and the script will generate for you
also a log file where you could see the version of the installed software.
